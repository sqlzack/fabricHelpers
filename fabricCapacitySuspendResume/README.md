# Auto Suspend/Resume Fabric Capacity Using Logic Apps

## Repository Purpose
This repository is meant to demonstrate how a Fabric Capacity could automatically be suspended or resumed on a schedule through the usage of Logic Apps. This could be helpful in development or trial scenarios. For example, if you have a capacity running in an Azure Tenant with the Visual Studio credit in place.
